# Amazon_Disaster_Plan
Hobby project designed to bother Amazon when packages don't arrive on time!
This program will parse your emails to find information about your amazon order dates. If you have not received your shipment after two days, it will send a tweet to Amazon complaining to entice their customer service to give you a free month of prime.

##Disclaimer
This program was designed specifically for our situation  as we live in an apartment that will send us email notifications about package delivery.
